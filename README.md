This is a project I have worked on for the COMP208 module as part of my Computer Science Degree in University of Liverpool.

As a group we have tried to make a recipe suggestion. The app does the bare minimum right now, but a few of the team members will be working on it after the module is done as it is a learning experience for us all.
